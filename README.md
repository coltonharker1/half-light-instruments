# Half Light Kontakt Instruments

Welcome to the Half Light Kontakt Instruments repository! This repository contains all of the KSP (Kontakt Scripting Language) files for the Kontakt instruments created specifically for Half Light.

## Requirements

To compile the code for use in a Kontakt instrument, you'll need the Sublime KSP add-on. This add-on enhances the development experience for Kontakt scripting by providing syntax highlighting, autocompletion, macros, and other useful features.

You can find the Sublime KSP add-on [here](https://github.com/nojanath/SublimeKSP) .

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Sublime Text installed.
3. Install the Sublime KSP add-on if you haven't already (follow the link above).
4. Open the KSP files in Sublime Text and start working on your Kontakt instruments.
